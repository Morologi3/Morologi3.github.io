Hi

I'm an undergraduate student in Information security at UAE University.

During studying for my courses in UAE University, I discovered my passion for Artificial Intelligence, and started to go deep into it. After that I discovered Andrew NG course on deep learning were it really helped me to enlighten my insight and remove difficulties.

On the research side, most of my works done in UAE University with Dr. Jose Berengueres, especially in structuring data, and building models to fetch these data.

My life outside all of this is reading about natural sciences, and history. To be satisfied as dark academian INTJ :)
